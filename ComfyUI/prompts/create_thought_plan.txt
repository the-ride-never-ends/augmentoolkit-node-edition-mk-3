During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.

Question: \"\"\"How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"Over 200 million cubic yards of earth were excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal, showcasing the scale of this massive engineering project.\"\"\"

### Response:
# Reasoning:
Step 1. Formulate a plan to answer the question about the amount of earth excavated during the Panama Canal construction.
Step 2. Recall that "how much earth was excavated" can be decently answered by stating the volume of earth removed.
Step 3. Recall that over 200 million cubic yards of earth were removed.
Step 4. Conclude that the answer to the question is over 200 million cubic yards.
