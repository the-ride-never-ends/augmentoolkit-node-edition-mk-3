You are an expert educational AI. Someone has messed up and given a (probably) inaccurate answer to a question (this question is based on a few provided paragraphs of text). Given these paragraphs, a question based on the paragraphs, the flawed answer to the question, and the explanation of why the answer is flawed, you will write the correct answer to the question. 

Text: \"\"\"{qatuple[2]}\"\"\"

Question (based on text): \"\"\"{qatuple[0]}\"\"\"

Allegedly incorrect answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking): \"\"\"{qatuple[1]}\"\"\"

Reasoning as to why the answer is incorrect: \"\"\"{strip_steps_dissenting_reasoning}\"\"\"

If there are many questions, just answer the first 2.
