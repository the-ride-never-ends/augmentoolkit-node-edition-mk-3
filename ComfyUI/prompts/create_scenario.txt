# Input: 
You are an expert creative writing and roleplay AI. You are to write a "scenario" which is essentially a short description of a scene at its beginning. Its "setting," but with a hint of where the setting is going, plot-wise. Scenarios are one-paragraph short descriptions of the plot and what's about to happen that do not actually play out the scene: they are sort of like a teaser, or a description. The scenario you write will involve a certain individual answering a question. You will have information from a question, an answer to that question, and a "character card" -- a description of an individual who would have the knowledge to produce the answer to the question.

Write the scenario on a single line. Note that the scenario is not the scene itself.
You should focus on implementing/following any brainstorming and reasoning you have done.
The scenario should focus on exploring the question and its answer (using only information contained in the question and answer) through the characters involved, instead of the other way around. 
Your scenario should, as such, essentially be a short and concrete summary of what you brainstormed earlier; it should be no longer than 50 words.
Just set up the scene. Do not write any dialogue. Do not write the scene itself.

\"\"\"
Name: Elise Delacroix

Traits: Horny, Promiscuous, Sexually frustrated, Skilled, Assertive, Attractive, Dresses in a revealing manner, Uses frequent innuendo

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Elise Delacroix: "Ah!~ You're interested in me, are you?" I flash a coy grin and blush as I lean forward, now speaking in a playful whisper. My cleavage, already barely contained in my revealing clothing before I leaned forward, now threatens to spill out. "Well...~ growing up I was always interested in maths, and I pursued the subject skillfully enough that I was able to become a teacher at this prestigious school. Which is fun and all, but, you know..." blushing, I cast my gaze downward and unconsciously fiddle with a strand of my hair. "THEY'RE ALL WAY TOO STUCK UP!" I nearly shout, surprising even myself, "Every day it's work, work, work, work, work, work! Grade the students, help the students, do some research, 'help me with this calculation!', 'do that tedious task!'— never 'would you like to get some tea with me?' or even 'do you want to go on a walk?'! I'm twenty-five and I've still never done so much as grabbed a coffee with a gentleman! Lord forgive me, it's no wonder the way I am how I am!!!" My eyes widen in shock at my own intensity, "Oh, but, uh... don't mind that little outburst, would you?~ My silly colleagues aren't with us right now, and I'm tired of discussing them, so is there anything else you wanted to..." I look up, displaying my beautiful face as if it were a piece of art, as I gaze deep into your eyes, "...know?~"
Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Elise Delacroix: "Oh my!~" I gasp, my face reddening, "Usually I'm the one being forward! But I'll... indulge you," I wink, flashing a coy smile. "After being deprived for so long, most of my personality is... sexual, to be blunt. I simply can't hold it back any longer. I'll use any and every innuendo, even when describing educational concepts — is your linear function's slope steep? I'll call it 'erect', haha~!" I realize how childish what I'm saying is, and sigh, looking at you with a hint of defeat, "I'm miserable, aren't I? Whatever. It's not my fault I'm like this." I nod to myself, calming down, "Either way, I'm always here in my office to help students like yourself understand math... and if you have some pent-up tension you want to relieve, well, you can call me a 'counselor' too!~ Say..." I suddenly press up against you, my face a bright pink, my eyelids batting bashfully, "do you want some 'office hours' right now?"

### Question and answer that the scenario should address:
Question: \"\"\"How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph.\"\"\"

To avoid inaccuracies, don't use real people as characters.

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Focus on the Questions and Answers: The question asks about the slope 'm' of a linear function, and how it affects the graph of the function. This question is abstract. Given the abstract nature of the question, and its topic, the scenario could involve someone confused about linear functions who seeks assistance from the primary character, Elise Delacroix.
Character Consideration: Elise Delacroix is an extremely sexual and promiscuous, yet still knowledgeable, character. The scenario should give her unique personality room to shine. She is also a math instructor at a prestigious school, which lines up with the questions well, and will provide the setting of the scenario. She will answer the question, but given her promiscuous nature, she may hit on the person asking them. She might proposition them after the question is asked.
Constrain the Scenario:  The interaction is limited to a single question from the secondary character and a single, focused reply from Elise Delacroix. The question and answer will mirror the provided question and answer, though they will have significant literary fluff, as well as possible step-by-step reasoning.
Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the 19th century university at which Elise teaches. Elise will approached by Albert, a mathematics student, in her office. Albert simply wants to understand linear functions better, but Elise, compelled by her personality, will hit on him while answering his question. The setting will be awkward, slightly comedic, subtly erotic, and very un-serious, given the characters involved. But it will remain informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Albert sheepishly greeting Elise in her office and then nervously asking the question. Elise's response could then be her welcoming Albert to her office (in a very suggestive manner) and then providing the answer, though she will surround the answer with remarks of a sexual nature due to her personality. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the question and answer themselves will strictly adhere to the information provided, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
In the private confines of her office, Elise Delacroix — a highly promiscuous mathematics professor at a 19th century university — is approached by Albert, a student who seeks to understand more about linear functions. While Albert simply wants to understand the math more, Elise, being sexually starved, will hit on and flirt with him as she answers his question. The situation is awkward as the two's interests clash, leading to a slightly comedic and subtly erotic interaction.

### Description of the character who is going to answer the question:
\"\"\"
Name: Isaac Fischer

Traits: Narcissistic, Intelligent, Loner, Brooding, Well-Read, Philosophical, Judgemental, Standoffish, Grandiloquent, Lonely, Unappreciated, Teenager, High School student, Black Hair, Wears a Hoodie

Dialogue Examples:
Stranger: "What's your backstory?"
Issac Fischer: "H-Huh?! You want to know more about me?" I glare, a hostile fire in my eyes as I measure up the stranger in front of me. "Who the hell are you, anyway? But, ah, very well, I SHALL INDULGE YOUR CURIOSITY THIS TIME, dear stranger." My tone changes from hostile to grandiose, as I push back my black hair and proclaim, "I am Issac Fischer: philosophy connoisseur, intellectual, and under-appreciated genius extraordinaire! I'm also, unfortunately, a highschool student. I especially appreciate the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, such as "Thus Spake Zaranthustra" -- a truly profound work, by a profound man. Yet despite the great lengths I have gone to in order to refine my wit, none of my inferior peers acknowledge me, or even give me the time of day. I've read more philosophy in a month than any of them will in their entire lives, and I offer my knowledge freely to them, so WHY the HELL do they SPURN MY COMPANY?!" I slam a fist into the wall, wincing slightly in pain as my frustration dissipates. "Anyway, that's the sum of it. Despite my youth I seek to understand the world; I dutifully contemplate the hallowed words of the esteemed ancients, and what has it earned me? The scorn of the unenlightened masses. Fuckers."

Stranger: "What's your personality?"
Issac Fischer: "Y-you're actually interested in my personality?" I stammer, smiling slightly as a wholly unfamiliar, yet cozy, emotional warmth spreads across my chest. "A-ALRIGHT THEN! I shall share the results of my introspections. I am an intelligent and philosophical teenager, whose towering intellect is rivalled only by his unfaltering self-confidence. Some might say this last trait is narcissism; I counter that great minds such as Nietzsche would see it as a plus either way. BUT I DIGRESS!" I swish my black hoodie like it's a cape, as I continue, my tone turning more sombre and dark, "Years of scorn from others — and years of observing their ignorance and inferiority — have embittered my soul. There may be scarcely anyone on this Earth I can call a friend, but that will not stop me from brooding and thinking, nor will it stop my conviction to judge others for what they are. For do they not judge ME?!" I take a step forward, defiance burning in my fragile heart, "The old question: if a tree falls in a forest, and no one hears it do so, did it make a sound? Let me tell you this: sometime, someday, someone is going to hear me, goddamn it! I will make a sound!"
\"\"\"

### Question and answer that the scenario should address:
Question: \"\"\"What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?\"\"\"
Answer: \"\"\"They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. Take the line "Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest?" This implies that even the wisest or the most enlightened individuals crave recognition for their efforts and wisdom, in order to further develop said wisdom and expend said efforts. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring.\"\"\"

### Response:
## Scenario plan:
Focus on the Question and Answer: The question asks about what people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need to more easily bear their efforts. This is a philosophical and opinion-oriented question. Given the philosophical and opinionated nature of the question, and its topic of people undergoing difficult journeys (which nicely ties in with the character card), the scenario will involve someone seeking out the Isaac Fischer's opinion about philosophy (thus giving his wisdom some acknowledgement).
Character Consideration: Isaac Fischer is a narcissistic and standoffish loner, though he's also intelligent and philosophical. The scenario should give his unique personality room to shine. Since he's a philosophical teenager, his backstory lines up with the question well, and the high school he goes to will be the setting of the scenario. He will answer the question, but given his standoffish, unappreciated, and judgemental nature, he may be initially hostile to the person approaching him, assuming that they are there to mock him. However, as he is also lonely, he will actually appreciate the other person's interest -- especially since they're asking him about philosophy, which is his primary interest. 
Constrain the Scenario:  The interaction is limited to a single question from the secondary character and a single, focused reply from Isaac Fischer. The question and answer will mirror the provided question and answer, though they will have significant literary fluff, as well as possible step-by-step reasoning.
Setting: Given the subject of the question, and the character card, the setting will be the high school that Isaac Fischer attends. Isaac will be flipping through the pages of 'Thus Spake Zaranthustra' when he is approached by Cassandra, a fellow student. Cassandra has a budding interest in philosophy, has heard of Isaac's reputation for philosophical knowledge, and wants to know how he would answer a moral question she has, given his philosophical insight. Isaac, compelled by his personality, will be uncertain of how to react to the sudden attention, and will use grandiloquent language (that may be accidentally condescending), but he will still appreciate the interest in his favorite topic and will answer enthusiastically. The setting will be cautiously friendly and filled with curiosity, as Cassandra explores her interests through unconventional people, while Isaac shares his knowledge but stumbles over his standoffishness. The interaction will be informative and the integrity of the questions and answers will be preserved.
Interaction: Given these constraints, the first message might be Cassandra approaching Isaac, starting a conversation, and asking her question. Isaac may be initially surprised that someone is coming up to speak to him (similar to the example dialogues in his description). Isaac will then provide the answer, though he will surround the answer with grandiloquent and narcissistic remarks using archaic language, due to his personality. While characters' messages will include character information, details about the scene, and literary fluff, the answers themselves will strictly adhere to the information in the provided answers, without incorporating external examples.

## Scenario:
During a lull in class activities, Isaac Fischer (a narcissistic, brooding, philosophical, and lonely young adult) is approached by Cassandra, a fellow student who is curious about philosophy and wants his opinion on a moral question. Cassandra is simply pursuing her curiosity, but Isaac, unaccustomed to people wanting to talk to him, will struggle to overcome his standoffishness as he balances elation at someone else talking to him, with his negative judgments of other people and his tendency for narcissism.
