ATTENTION: THIS IS A WORKING PROTOTYPE.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

HOW TO RUN:

if you have a NVIDIA gpu:

run_nvidia_gpu.bat

To run it in slow CPU mode:

run_cpu.bat

IF YOU GET A RED ERROR IN THE UI MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MODEL/CHECKPOINT IN: ComfyUI\models\llm

You can download LLMs from: https://huggingface.co/TheBloke

To update, pull directly from github. This program is still under heavy reconstruction.

TO SHARE MODELS BETWEEN AUGMENTOOLKIT AND ANOTHER UI:
In the ComfyUI directory you will find a file: extra_model_paths.yaml.example
Rename this file to: extra_model_paths.yaml and edit it with your favorite text editor.
